*** When using this library...

please cite the paper:

   Marc Toussaint (2009): Robot Trajectory Optimization using Approximate
   Inference. 25nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2009). 

please read the guide:

   doc/guide.pdf



*** Installation

(1) On Debian, install the packages liblapack-dev, freeglut3-dev,
    libqhull-dev, libf2c2-dev.

(2) Try 'make' in the base directory.

(3) If that didn't work: have a look in the make-config in the base
    directory. Also have a look at the `Known issues' given below. If
    linking with glut, lapack, swift, or qhull failed, remove the
    respective -DMT_* flags in the make-config. If the linker
    complained about undefined template function references, uncomment
    the -DMT_IMPLEMENT_TEMPLATES entry in make-config (this will lead
    to slow compilation when including my headers). If it still
    doesn't work, contact me.

(4) Try test/soc/x.exe

(5) Briefly try all other tests in test/*/x.exe

(6) Read the guide!



*** Known issues:

-- On older Ubuntu/Debian releases, the libf2c2-dev is not up to date
   (version<10061008-4.1). Running the code might lead to seg faults
   within the lapack library complaining about some fortran linking.

-- For some libqhull-dev versions (unequal 2003.1-11) there is a
   compiler error 'ors_qhull.cpp:324 ... is not a pointer'. Simply
   change the -> to a .

-- On some systems one needs to add `-lcblas' in make-generic:277
