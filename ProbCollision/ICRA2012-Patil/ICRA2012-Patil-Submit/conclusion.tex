We have presented an analytical method to estimate a priori the probability of collision for a mobile robot operating under Gaussian motion and sensing uncertainty. We have shown that it is necessary to consider the correlations between the a priori probability distributions of the robot state, to accurately estimate the true distributions and consequently, the probability of collision. We have also proposed a novel method for approximating the distribution of feasible states with truncated Gaussian distributions. Our method is directly applicable to a variety of motion planning under uncertainty methods \cite{vandenBerg11_IJRR, Vitus11_ICRA, Bry11_ICRA, vandenBerg11_ISRR, Toussaint09_ICML} to improve the quality and safety of the computed plans.

We plan to integrate our method with other motion planning under uncertainty methods, including improving the safety of computed plans in deformable environments \cite{Patil11_RSS}, and elegantly handle state constraints in optimization based approaches \cite{vandenBerg11_ISRR}. We also plan to extend our method to handle more general cases where the orientation of the robot is also relevant for collision detection. A natural extension is to investigate how our method can be extended to incorporate uncertainty in sensing obstacles in the environment \cite{Guibas08_WAFR}. Another interesting avenue for future research is to look at applications with unilateral contacts where the distribution of feasible states is no longer Gaussian \cite{Erez10_UAI}. It might be possible to approximate such non-Gaussian distributions using mixture of Gaussians and truncating them with respect to constraints on the robot state.
