Explicitly considering uncertainty in robot motion and sensing during motion planning enables the computation of safer plans. Motion planners that consider uncertainty have been developed for a variety of domains and settings \cite{Alterovitz07_RSS, Kurniawati08_RSS, Guibas08_WAFR, Prentice09_IJRR, Platt10_RSS, vandenBerg11_IJRR, Patil11_RSS, Bry11_ICRA, Vitus11_ICRA}.

A key step of many motion planning methods that consider uncertainty is to estimate the probability of collision of a motion plan. Efficient Monte-Carlo sampling strategies have been used to accurately estimate the probability of collision \cite{Lambert06_ICARV, duToit11_TRO}. Other methods generally characterize the uncertainty of the robot's position by estimating the a priori probability distributions of the robot state along a given plan. A common approach is to check for collisions between these distributions and obstacles to compute an upper bound for the collision probability, which is used as a metric to evaluate the safety of the plan \cite{vandenBerg11_IJRR, Patil11_RSS}. Another approach is to use these distributions to compute a conservative probability bound using Boole's inequality \cite{Vitus11_ICRA, Bry11_ICRA}. %However, these methods incorrectly assume that the probabilities of collision are independent, which results in overly conservative plans.

The use of truncated Gaussian distributions \cite{Book:Johnson94} has been previously explored by Simon \cite{Book:Simon06} in the context of optimal state estimation with state constraints, but this work does not consider motion uncertainty. Greytak \cite{Thesis:Greytak09} provides an analytical method to compute the probability of collision using truncated Gaussians but does not consider sensing uncertainty. %and only truncates the state distributions with respect to the obstacle closest to the robot state being considered. 
Toussaint \cite{Toussaint09_ICML} uses truncated Gaussians in an expectation-propagation framework for Bayesian inference, but the truncation result is dependent on the order in which constraints are processed, which leads to problems with convergence of the algorithm \cite{Toussaint09_NIPS}. In contrast, we propose a novel order-independent algorithm for truncating Gaussian distributions with respect to hard state constraints.
