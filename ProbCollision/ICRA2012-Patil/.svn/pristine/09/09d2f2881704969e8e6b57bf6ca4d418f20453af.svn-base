We present an analytical method for estimating the probability of collision of a motion plan for a mobile robot operating under the assumptions of Gaussian motion and sensing uncertainty. Estimating the probability of collision is an integral step in many algorithms for motion planning under uncertainty and is crucial for characterizing the safety of motion plans. In contrast to prior work, our method provides highly accurate estimates by specifically accounting for the fact that the probabilities of collision at each stage along the plan are conditioned on the previous stages being collision free. We propose a novel method for truncating the a priori state distributions with respect to obstacles, correctly propagating them forward in time, and accurately estimating the collision probability of the plan. Our method can be directly applied within a variety of existing motion planners to improve their performance and the quality of computed plans. 
We apply our method to a car-like mobile robot with second order dynamics and to a steerable medical needle in 3D and demonstrate that our method for estimating the probability of collision is orders of magnitude faster than na\"{i}ve Monte-Carlo sampling methods and reduces estimation error by more than 25\% compared to prior methods. 
%We also show that the mean error in estimating the probability of collision using our method is considerably lesser as compared to prior methods, while incurring negligible computational overhead.
