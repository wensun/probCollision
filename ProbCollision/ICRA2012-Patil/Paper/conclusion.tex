We have presented an analytical method to estimate \emph{a priori} the probability of collision for a mobile robot operating under Gaussian motion and sensing uncertainty. We have shown that it is necessary to consider the correlations between the \emph{a priori} probability distributions of the robot state, to accurately estimate the true distributions and consequently, the probability of collision. We have also proposed a novel method for approximating the distribution of feasible states with truncated Gaussian distributions. Our method is computationally fast, enabling its use in online motion planning, and computes conservative estimates of the collision probability. Our method is directly applicable to a variety of motion planning under uncertainty methods \cite{vandenBerg11_IJRR, Vitus11_ICRA, Bry11_ICRA, Erez10_UAI, Toussaint09_ICML} to improve the performance and safety of motion plans.

We assume that the robot operates under the assumptions of Gaussian motion and sensing uncertainty, which might not be an acceptable approximation in some applications where multi-modal beliefs are expected to appear. However, the class of problems where Gaussian distributions are applicable is large, as is proven by the widespread use of the extended Kalman filter for state estimation, for instance in
mobile robotics. In future work we plan to apply our method to real-world problems that involve complex dynamics and that would benefit from a fast planner that considers uncertainty, including autonomous quadrotor flight, medical needle steering, and planning in deformable environments \cite{Patil11_RSS}. We also plan to extend our method to handle non-point robots and to incorporate other sources of uncertainty such as imprecise sensing of obstacles in the environment \cite{Guibas08_WAFR}. %Another avenue for future research is to look at applications with unilateral contacts where the distribution of feasible states is no longer Gaussian \cite{Erez10_UAI}.
